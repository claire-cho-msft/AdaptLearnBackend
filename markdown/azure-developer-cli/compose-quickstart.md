# Build a minimal template using the Azure Developer CLI compose feature

The Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) composability (compose) feature enables you to progressively compose the Azure resources required for your app without manually writing Bicep code. In this article, you learn how to work with the compose feature to build a minimal template. Visit the [`azd` compose overview](azd-compose.md) article for more conceptual information about this feature.

> [!NOTE]
> The `azd` compose feature is currently in alpha and shouldn't be used in production apps. Changes to alpha features in subsequent releases can result in breaking changes. Visit the [azd feature versioning and release strategy](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/feature-versioning) and [feature stages](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/blob/main/cli/azd/docs/feature-stages.md) pages for more information. Use the **Feedback** button on the upper right to share feedback about the `compose` feature and this article.

## Work with the compose feature

Access `azd` compose features through the [`azd add`](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/reference#azd-add) command. The `azd add` command works with templates created using the following `azd init` workflows:

- **Use code in the current directory** (for apps that target Azure Container Apps for hosting)
- **Create a minimal project**

Templates initialized through the **Select a template** flow aren't currently supported. The `azd` compose feature manages infrastructure for you and isn't compatible with templates that have existing `infra` folder assets. Visit the [Generate the Bicep code](compose-generate.md) article and [template creation workflows](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/make-azd-compatible) page for more information.

Complete the following steps to add new resources to your template without writing any code:

1. In a terminal window, navigate to the root of your `azd` template.

1. Run the `azd add` command to add a new resource and start the compose workflow:

    ```bash
    azd add
    ```

1. Select one of the supported resources to add to your app. For this example, select `Database`.

    ```output
    ? What would you like to add? [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
    > AI
      Database
      Host service
      Key Vault
      Messaging
      Storage account
      ~Existing resource
    ```

1. For the type of database, select `PostgreSQL`.

    ```output
    ? Which type of database?  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
      MongoDB
    > PostgreSQL
      Redis
    ```

1. Enter a name for the new resource, such as `azddb`.

    ```output
    ? Input the name of the app database (PostgreSQL)
    ```

1. If your app contains services, `azd` prompts you to select the service that uses this resource.

    ```output
    ? Select the service(s) that uses this resource
    > [âœ“]  webfrontend
    ```

1. `azd` generates a preview of the required changes to the `azure.yaml` file. Press **Enter** to accept and apply the changes.

    ```output
    Previewing changes to azure.yaml:
    
    +  azddata:
    +      type: db.postgres
    
       webfrontend:
           type: host.containerapp
           uses:
               - azddb
    +          - azddata
           port: 80
    ```

1. Run the `azd up` command to provision any changes made through the `azd add` command. In this example, `azd` provisions a PostgreSQL database in Azure.

1. Run the `azd add` command again to add other resources, such as an OpenAI service.

## Explore the azure.yaml file

`azure.yaml` is the configuration file that `azd` uses to manage your app. `azd` manages the services and resources composed through the `azd add` command using the corresponding `services` and `resources` nodes. Consider the following example of an `azure.yaml` file updated entirely through `azd add`:

```yml
name: azdcomposesample
metadata:
  template: azd-init@1.11.0
services:
  webfrontend:
    project: src
    host: containerapp
    language: dotnet
resources:
  webfrontend:
    type: host.containerapp
    port: 80
    uses:
      - azdsql
      - azdchat
  azdsql:
    type: db.postgres
  azdchat:
    type: ai.openai.model
    model:
      name: gpt-4o
      version: "2024-08-06"
```

- The `services` node declares:
    - A deployment mapping named `webfrontend` between a .NET web app in the `src` directory and Azure Container Apps.
- The `resources` node declares:
    - An Azure container app and a matching dependency mapping named `webfrontend` between the hosted .NET container app and the database and AI service it depends on. The `uses` node maps the app to the other resources it depends on.
    - An Azure Database for PostgreSQL resource named `azdsql`.
    - An Azure OpenAI resource named `azdchat`.
