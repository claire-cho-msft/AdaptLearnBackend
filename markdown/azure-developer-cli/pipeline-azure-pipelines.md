# Create an Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline using the Azure Developer CLI

This article shows how to use the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) to create a CI/CD pipeline with Azure DevOps Pipelines (Azure Pipelines) for an `azd` template. The pipeline enables you to push updates to a code repository and have your changes automatically provisioned and deployed to your Azure environment.

> [!NOTE]
> The `azd pipeline config` command is in beta. For details, see the [feature versioning and release strategy](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/feature-versioning).

## Prerequisites

- [Install the Azure Developer CLI](install-azd.md).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed.

## Initialize the template

This example uses the [Hello-AZD](https://github.com/azure-samples/hello-azd) template, but you can follow these steps for any template that includes a pipeline definition file (found in the `.github` or `.azdo` folders).

1. In an empty directory, initialize the `hello-azd` template:

   ```azdeveloper
   azd init -t hello-azd
   ```

1. When prompted, enter a name for the environment (for example, *hello-azd*).

## Set up Azure Pipelines

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using Azure Pipelines for a Java template on Windows, see [the troubleshooting guide](./troubleshoot.md#azd-pipeline-config-using-azdo-for-java-templates-on-windows).

### Create or use an Azure Pipelines organization

To use Azure Pipelines, you need an organization. Create one at https://dev.azure.com if you don't already have one.

### Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)

The Azure Developer CLI requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) to configure Azure Pipelines. [Create a new PAT](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate#create-a-pat) with the following scopes:

- Agent Pools (read, manage)
- Build (read and execute)
- Code (full)
- Project and team (read, write, and manage)
- Release (read, write, execute, and manage)
- Service Connections (read, query, and manage)

### Configure the pipeline

1. Run the following command to configure an Azure Pipelines project and repository with a deployment pipeline:

   ```azdeveloper
   azd pipeline config --provider azdo
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > By default, `azd pipeline config` for Azure Pipelines uses client credentials. OIDC/federated credentials are not currently supported.
   > [Learn more about OIDC support in `azd`.](./faq.yml#what-is-openid-connect--oidc---and-is-it-supported)

1. Respond to the prompts:

   - **Personal Access Token (PAT):**
     - Paste your PAT.
     - Optionally, export your PAT as a system environment variable to avoid repeated prompts:

       ```azdeveloper
       export AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT=<PAT>
       ```

   - **Azure Pipelines Organization Name:**
     - Enter your organization name. This value is saved in the `.env` file for the current environment.

   - **A remote named "origin" was not found. Would you like to configure one?**
     - Yes

   - **How would you like to configure your project?**
     - Create a new Azure Pipelines Project

   - **Enter the name for your new Azure Pipelines Project OR Hit enter to use this name: ( {default name} )**
      - Select **Enter**, or create a unique project name.

   - **Would you  like to commit and push your local changes to start the configured CI pipeline?**
      - Yes

1. To verify the build, go to your project in the Azure Pipelines portal (https://dev.azure.com).

## Make and push a code change

1. In the `/src/components/pages` directory, open `Home.razor`.
2. Change the `Hello AZD!` header text to `Hello, pipeline!` and save the file.
3. Create a branch and commit your change. The `main` branch is protected, so push your changes from a new branch and create a Pull Request in Azure Pipelines. The pull request triggers the pipeline and blocks merging if the pipeline fails.
4. Approve and merge your pull request to start the pipeline again.

5. In your browser, open your project's repository to see your commit and the Azure Pipeline run.

6. Visit the web frontend URL to inspect the update.

## Use `azd` as an Azure Pipelines task

Add [`azd` as an Azure Pipelines task](https://aka.ms/azd-azdo-task) to install `azd` in your pipeline. Add the following to `.azdo/pipelines/azure-dev.yml`:

```yaml
trigger:
  - main
  - branch

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest
  # vmImage: windows-latest

steps:
  - task: setup-azd@0
    displayName: Install azd
```

## Clean up resources

When you no longer need the Azure resources created in this article, run:

```azdeveloper
azd down
```
