# Create Azure Developer CLI templates overview

The Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) utilizes [templates](azd-templates.md) to provision and deploy app resources to the cloud. Developers can add support for `azd` commands and features by converting their applications to templates. This article provides a contextual overview of the different options for building `azd` templates. Once you understand the concepts in this article, visit the following resources for more detailed implementation guides:

- [Use an existing template for your app](start-with-existing-template.md).
- [Create a template from your app code](start-with-app-code.md)
- [Training - build and deploy `azd` templates](/training/paths/azure-developer-cli)

> [!NOTE]
> This article assumes a general understanding of `azd` templates. Visit the [template overview](azd-templates.md) doc for more information about templates.

## Template creation concepts

Creating an `azd` template requires adding specific configuration and infrastructure assets to your existing code base, or starting a new app from an existing template those same assets. Both workflows are explained in later sections. All `azd` templates share a similar file structure based around `azd` conventions. The following diagram gives a quick overview of the process to create an `azd` template:

Every `azd` template requires the following minimum resources:

- An `infra` folder that holds the infrastructure as code (Bicep or Terraform) files.
- An `azure.yaml` configuration file that maps your application services to the provisioned infrastructure resources.

Other optional directories are often included as well, such as a `.github` folder with assets to create a CI/CD pipeline. Visit the [template overview](azd-templates.md) doc for more information about templates.

Consider the following sample app repository:

After converting this sample app to an `azd` template, the same app repository contains the following:

:::image type="content" source="media/make-azd-compatible/azd-template-structure-complete.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the completed structure of the azd template.":::

The original app resources are unchanged, but new assets were added that `azd` depends on for commands such as `azd up`:

- An `infra` folder was added that includes Bicep files to create Azure resources.
- An `azure.yaml` configuration file was added to map the app code in the `src` directory to the provision Azure resources.
- A `.azure` folder was created to hold `azd` environment variables.
- A `.github` folder (optional) was added to support CI/CD pipelines through GitHub actions.

## Template creation workflows

The `azd init` command is used to initialize an `azd` template for provisioning and deploying the app resources on Azure. The command prompts you to choose between two different workflows to initialize a template that are outlined in the following sections - **Use code in the current directory** and **Use an existing template**.

Run the `azd init` command in the root of the directory you'd like to convert to an `azd template`:

```azdeveloper
azd init
```

### Use code in the current directory

This option instructs `azd` to analyze the code in your directory to identity which technologies it uses, such as the programming language, framework and database system. `azd` automatically generates template assets for you, such as the `azure.yaml` service definition file and the `infra` folder with infrastructure-as-code files. The generated assets are a starting point for additional modifications. Use this approach if you plan to use common Azure services supported by `azd` scaffolding features.

Visit the [Start with your app code to create a template](start-with-app-code.md) tutorial for details on how to implement this approach and more information on which Azure resources support automatic detection and scaffolding.

### Select a template

Select this option to use an existing template that defines many of your Azure resources and architectural goals as a starting point. `azd` will prompt you to select a starter template or another template from the [awesome-azd](https://azure.github.io/awesome-azd/) gallery. When you select a template, the assets of that template are added to your existing project directory to use as a starting point. Some templates include sample app code that you can replace with your own, while some (called "starter templates") are infrastructure only.

Use the `azd init` command to pull down an existing template to an empty directory and use it as a starting point for your own app. If the template includes app source code, you can either build off of that code or replace the source code directory with your own.

Visit the [Start with an existing template](start-with-existing-template.md) tutorial for details on how to implement this approach.
